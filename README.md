### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ 

I'm Florencia and I'm currently living in Brazil. First of all, I'm passionate about music, have played guitar many years and also studied to be a sound engineer but later started to be intrested in technology and programming. I'm currently studying to be a Software Developer, already with knowledge in Java, C++, PHP, Html, CSS, MySQL, among other subjects; with the desire to combine both areas in the future.
